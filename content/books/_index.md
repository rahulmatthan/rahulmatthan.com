title: "Reading"
---

I have, for longer than I can remember, read 50 books a year. I am interested in a wide range of topics - from books on science and technology to economics, politics and the Making of Modern India. As hard as it is to pick a favourite, I have tried to list my current top 10 across the following categories. Given that I keep reading new books I expect that this list will change frequently.
