I moderated a conversation between Matthew Prince, CEO of Cloudflare and Rajan Anandan, Managing Director of Peak XV, on the need for an open Internet where access to AI is not determined by the founders of a few US-based companies. It was a wide ranging conversation that covered how countries of the Global South should think about the AI stack, the use of data and the economics of open source.
