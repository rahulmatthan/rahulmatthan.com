My interview with Dr Roshani Sanghani on her book 'Turn Around Diabetes,' about the myths surrounding diabetes treatment that keep India stuck in a reactive cycle of care. Diabetes is a major epidemic in India, with an estimated 77 million people suffering from it and nearly 25 million who are prediabetic. The conversation focuses on how to shift the trajectory of chronic illness management by equipping people with the tools to intervene meaningfully.
