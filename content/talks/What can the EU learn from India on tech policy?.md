I was interviewed by Gautam Kamath for 'Europolis: the Global Europe podcast' on India's data protection framework and how it has been integrated into its digital public infrastructure. We cover India's decade-long experience in digitising its economy, and how it offers valuable lessons for Europe's own digital future.
