As part of the India AI Impact Summit, I participated in a panel discussion on data sharing. I discussed the paper we had developed in the Expert Engagement Group on "New Deal for Data" that I had chaired as part of the Summit and the fundamental questions it raised about whether our data governance laws remain fit for purpose. I was joined on the panel by Saranya Gopinath who also has a paper out on Federated Data Markets, Chenai Chair leader of the Masakhane African Languages Hub, and Vijay Sureshkumar from the Gates Foundation. The panel was expertly moderated by Astha Kapoor of the Aapti Institute.
