At the India AI Summit, I moderated a session between Shilpa Kolhatkar from NVidia, Sudeep Shrivasthava from the Ministry of IT, Government of India, Tulio Andrade from the COP30 Presidency and Daniel Abadie of CoDevelop. We discussed how countries of the Global South think about sovereignty and resilience in the AI age and what AI means for climate change.
