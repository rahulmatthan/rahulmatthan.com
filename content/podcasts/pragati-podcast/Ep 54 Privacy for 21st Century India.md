I appeared on the Pragati podcast with Pavan Srinath and Hamsini Hariharan. 

We discussed my book Privacy 3.0 and how personal data has never been more valuable, and has never been at more risk. I talked about my involvement in drafting a data protection law, and shared stories from the legal and legislative history of privacy in India.
