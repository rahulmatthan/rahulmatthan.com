I appeared on the First Principles podcast with Rohin Dharmakumar. 

We spoke about the business of law, the challenges of building a professional services firm in India and pretty much anywhere in the world, and the somewhat counterintuitive model that Trilegal adopted to foster a culture of collaboration over individual stardom.
