In the first episode of the Ex Machina podcast I sit down with Justice Srikrishna for a wide ranging discussion on the many issues that he has been involved in - from the Mumbai riots to financial sector reform. But for the most part the interview focuses on data privacy and his critical role in shaping India’s law.
