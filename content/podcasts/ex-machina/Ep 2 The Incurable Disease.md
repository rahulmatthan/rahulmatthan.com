In the second episode of the Ex Machina podcast, we discuss rare diseases            . There are certain rare diseases that have for a long time been thought to be incurable. Today, radical new therapies are being developed, largely on an experimental basis in laboratories in the developed world. This episode tells the story of one Indian family’s heroic effort to find the cure for an incurable disease, racing against time to try and save their son’s life.
