title: "Ex Machina"
---

Since 2016, I have written a weekly column in the Mint on the intersection between law, technology and society. My articles have covered a range of issues and for that duration of time have served as a record of the way in which technology policy has evolved in the country. The entire archive of all my Ex Machina articles are available on this page.
